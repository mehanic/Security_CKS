# CiliumNetworkPolicy only allows to bind a policy restricted to a particular namespace.
#  There can be situations where one wants to have a cluster-scoped effect of the policy,
#   which can be done using Ciliumâ€™s CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy Kubernetes custom resource.
#    The specification of the policy is same as that of CiliumNetworkPolicy except that it is not namespaced.

# In the cluster, this policy will allow ingress traffic from pods matching the label name=luke
#  from any namespace to pods matching the labels name=leia in any namespace.
