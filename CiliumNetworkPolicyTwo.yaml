# We have a team of developers and administrators who need to access the cluster 
# from outside the office, and weâ€™re routing their incoming traffic through a VPN with the 
# IP address 172.27.224.3, as an administrator, 
# I want to ensure all developers and administrators using this VPN can access the database pods.

# Since all the incoming external traffic to our database pod is routed through a VPN,
#  this user story entails that the only external IP address that can access our database 
#  pods is the IP address of the VPN server. Cilium Network Policy provides CIDR-based policies 
#  for controlling traffic to known IP addresses and CIDRs. The fromCIDR and fromCIDRSet fields 
#  in the spec define ingress traffic rules, and toCIDR and toCIDRSet define egress traffic rules. 
#  The toCIDRSet field allows us to define exclusion rules for subnets within a CIDR.
